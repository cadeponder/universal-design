          25% of the adult population in America has some form of disability, that is 61 million people just counting adults. Of those who have some form of disability, 4.6% of folks are affected by blindness or serious loss of vision. In many countries there is a general trend towards having an “aging population”... And if you’re currently “young”, you will be a part of a future population that has fewer young folks to support them and paired with an increasing need for assistance yourself. Better start planning, or designing, for our collective future as old folks surrounded by increasingly complex technologies that may soon leave us being the ones sending frustrated texts to our future grandchildren and hope they don’t ignore our requests.</p>

          The world is digitizing and is rewarding industries, entrepreneurs, and platforms that embrace the changing landscape of human interactions. Digitizing also comes at the cost of losing usability for folks who can’t interface as smoothly with how content is displayed online. This can manifest in many forms including, but not limited to:
        </p>
          <ul class"listContent">
            <li>Users who perceive color differently being unable to read text / parse information shown through color choice.
            </li>
            <li>Users who rely on screen readers can’t access important information within reason, or can’t access key functions that rely on visual queues and interactions. Additionally, these users can’t access the information shown through infographics without added metadata their screenreader can access.
            </li>
            <li>Having trouble efficiently parsing information due to text size as you age.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Moving beyond thinking of yourself, let's step into the perspective of a potential user who has trouble navigating their way through the internet:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grace is a student at a university that does not currently have many resources to assist those with visual impairments. She has accommodations and relies on her screenreader but frequently spends too much time trying to navigate her professors’ websites with her screen reader to access important documents regarding assignments and submissions. Her professors say it would take too much time to restructure their websites just for “one student” and the school is hesitant to pour money into gaining more resources for students like Grace.</em></p>
          <p>
            This user persona shows how crucial it is for accessible web development practices be utilized, if Grace’s professor had followed certain guidelines he could have ensured all students have access without adding much work initially. Unfortunately, in this scenario, the professor’s response reflects many people’s responses to having to “fix” something that could have been structured properly from the beginning.</p>

          If you are familiar with SEO (Search Engine Optimization) then you may be interested in utilizing accessible web development to increase SEO. Using certain HTML5 semantics, such as H1, have the potential to increase your SEO since they give the search engine more metadata to work with and can better field your content to relevant customers. Using HTML5 semantics as a fail-safe for your website is costless to SEO and at times can even boost SEO.
        </p>
        <p>There is also an overlap between the data assistive technology reads, such as screen readers and assistive technology from Apple, and what search engines use to optimize searches for their users. Learn more about how certain HTML5 semantics impact SEO <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/news/html-tags-for-seo.html">HERE</a>.
